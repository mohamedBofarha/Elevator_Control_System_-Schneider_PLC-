## üîß Implementation Steps
1. Define elevator sequence and operations using **Grafcet diagrams**.  
2. Program **movement, floor selection, and safety features** in Ladder Logic.  
3. Integrate sensors and actuators with the PLC.  
4. Test system under different scenarios:
   - Normal operation  
   - Emergency stops  
   - Overload detection  
5. Debug and optimize sequences for smooth and safe operation.
